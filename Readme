# Rotational CORDIC Implementation

This repository contains an efficient implementation of the CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm for calculating trigonometric, hyperbolic, and complex functions. The CORDIC algorithm operates by iteratively rotating a vector until it aligns with the desired angle, utilizing only shift and add operations, making it suitable for hardware implementation. This implementation focuses on rotational CORDIC, where the algorithm is optimized for angle computation. The code provided here is designed for easy integration into embedded systems, specialized processors, or other hardware environments where resource efficiency is crucial. By leveraging rotational CORDIC, precise angle calculations can be achieved with minimal hardware resources, making it ideal for various applications such as signal processing, graphics rendering, and digital communications.
