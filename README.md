# Rotational CORDIC Implementation

This repository contains an efficient implementation of the CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm for calculating trigonometric, hyperbolic, and complex functions.

The CORDIC algorithm operates by iteratively rotating a vector until it aligns with the desired angle, utilizing only shift and add operations, making it suitable for hardware implementation. 

This implementation focuses on rotational CORDIC, where the algorithm is optimized for angle computation. The code provided here is designed for easy integration into embedded systems, specialized processors, or other hardware environments where resource efficiency is crucial. By leveraging rotational CORDIC, precise angle calculations can be achieved with minimal hardware resources, making it ideal for various applications such as signal processing, graphics rendering, and digital communications.


# Reciprocal CORDIC Implementation

Reciprocal CORDIC is a variant of the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm, designed specifically to efficiently compute reciprocal (inverse) trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

Reciprocal CORDIC focuses on computing the reciprocal of a given value using iterative approximation techniques. This technique is particularly useful in embedded systems and hardware implementations where hardware resources are limited, as it offers a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. By utilizing simple shift and add operations iteratively, Reciprocal CORDIC provides an efficient means of computing reciprocals without requiring complex arithmetic operations. It finds applications in areas such as signal processing, digital communications, and scientific computing, where fast and resource-efficient computation of reciprocal functions is crucial.
